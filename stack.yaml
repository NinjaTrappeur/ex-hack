    # Resolver to choose a 'specific' stackage snapshot or a compiler version.
    # A snapshot resolver dictates the compiler version and the set of packages
    # to be used for project dependencies. For example:
    #
    # resolver: lts-3.5
    # resolver: nightly-2015-09-21
    # resolver: ghc-7.10.2
    # resolver: ghcjs-0.1.0_ghc-7.10.2
    # resolver:
    #  name: custom-snapshot
    #  location: "./custom-snapshot.yaml"
    resolver: nightly-2018-07-11
    # User packages to be built.
    # Various formats can be used as shown in the example below.
    #
    # packages:
    # - some-directory
    # - https://example.com/foo/bar/baz-0.0.2.tar.gz
    # - location:
    #    git: https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack.git

    #   extra-dep: true
    #  subdirs:
    #  - auto-update
    #  - wai
    #
    # A package marked 'extra-dep: true' will only be built if demanded by a
    # non-dependency (i.e. a user package), and its test suites and benchmarks
    # will not be run. This is useful for tweaking upstream packages.
    packages:
    - .
    # Dependency packages to be pulled from upstream that are not in the resolver
    # (e.g., acme-missiles-0.3)
